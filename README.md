# Will's Writing Workflow

Everyone has a different method for writing papers, each being most conducive to the individual. This can make collaborations with others somewhat cumbersome as adapting to a new workflow may require a learning curve. In an attempt to clearly demonstrate the workflow I use as well as provide some learning material for tools like Overleaf, Zotero and R Markdown, I have put together a detailed workflow that I use to write papers.

As you can see, the workflow is relatively simple and requires little steps. However, it may include some tools unfamiliar to others. Here, I use three tools: R Markdown, Overleaf and Zotero. An initial document is created in R Markdown. The $\LaTeX$ output is then uploaded to a project in Overleaf, where additional edits and adjustments can be made by the author and/or collaborators. Once revisions have been made, a new R Markdown file is created that will address these edits (source control!). This process will repeat until a final manuscript is created.

## What you need <a name="2"></a>

Let's begin by installing [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and [R Studio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/). Then create an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account. These are the three main programs used in the workflow.
