# Will's Writing Workflow

Everyone has a different method for writing papers, each being most conducive to the individual. This can make collaborations with others somewhat cumbersome as adapting to a new workflow may require a learning curve. In an attempt to clearly demonstrate the workflow I use as well as provide some learning material for tools like Overleaf, Zotero and R Markdown, I have put together a detailed workflow that I use to write papers.
